# AI-for-Healthcare-Nanodegree
The AI for Healthcare Nanodegree dives deep into enhancing clinical decision-making with machine learning to build the treatments of the future. The program consists of four primary projects shown below. The initial focus is on  classifying and segmenting 2D and 3D medical images to augment diagnosis. Thereafter, modeling patient outcomes with electronic health records to optimize clinical trial testing decisions. Finally, the focus will be to build an algorithm that uses data collected from wearable devices to estimate the wearerâ€™s pulse rate in the presence of motion.

Currently working on the first project.

# Projects 
- [Project 1](https://github.com/atkatchev/pneumonia-detection-from-chest-x-rays) - Application AI to derive clinically-relevant insights on **2D imaging data (X-ray)**. Extract 2D images from DICOM files and apply appropriate tools to perform data exploration and analysis.
