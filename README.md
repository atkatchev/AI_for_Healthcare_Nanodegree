# AI-for-Healthcare-Nanodegree
The AI for Healthcare Nanodegree dives deep into enhancing clinical decision-making with machine learning to build the treatments of the future. The program consists of four primary projects shown below. The initial focus is on  classifying and segmenting 2D and 3D medical images to augment diagnosis. Thereafter, modeling patient outcomes with electronic health records to optimize clinical trial testing decisions. Finally, the focus will be to build an algorithm that uses data collected from wearable devices to estimate the wearer’s pulse rate in the presence of motion.

Currently working on the first project.

# Projects 
- [Project 1](https://github.com/atkatchev/pneumonia-detection-from-chest-x-rays) - Analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device.
Project Highlight

-    recommend appropriate imaging modalities for common clinical applications of 2D medical imaging
-    perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance
-    establish the appropriate ‘ground truth’ methodologies for training algorithms to label medical images
-    extract images from a DICOM dataset
-    train common CNN architectures to classify 2D medical images
-    translate outputs of medical imaging models for use by a clinician
-    plan necessary validations to prepare a medical imaging model for regulatory approval

File descriptions
-    EDA.ipynb: This is the file where Exploratory Data Analysis of, visualizing, summarizing and interpreting the dataset was done 
-    Build and train model.ipynb: This is the file where the model was built and trained.
-    Inference.ipynb: This is the file where clinical workflow integration was performed.
-    .dcm files: They are the test files to test the clinical workflow integration.
-    FDA_Submission_Template.md: This is the template used to create the FDA submission. Also saved as a .pdf file.
